## Life in General

Back in 2018 when we decided to move from southwest Colorado to Charlotte we said that we were done moving. However, immediately upon arriving in North Carolina, we knew it was a mistake to leave the Rockies. But for a number of reasons we decided to try and stick it out.

Fast forward to June of this year, we did a big family vacation back to Colorado and before we even got there the excitement was real. Within a few days, we knew we had to come back. One of the perks of COVID is that it has boomed the housing market in Charlotte, because of a mass exodus from places like New York and New Jersey, so we were able to sell house and leave with a nice check at the end. Of course most of that went to the move but we found a place we truly love.

In regards to our son, we still have no idea what's going on with him outside of hypotonia and appraxia, both of which explain his low muscle tone and difficulty speaking. But that's not a diagnosis that comes with much assistance, so we're still trying to figure out what to do.

COVID killed my attempts at the Spartan Trifecta, but it wasn't helped by me breaking my foot in seven places and getting a Lisfranc injury doing burpees over a barbell. But I'm doing great now, and considering giving it another attempt in 2021.

Since where we live doesn't have an F3 region, I am considering getting on started up here as well. It would be a great way to get plugged in to the community and bring people together.

This year I've also read _a lot_ about Stoicism and find that it works quite well with how I already think, so it has been a great blessing in many ways. It's rejuvinated my love of reading and I've enjoyed finding ways to incorporate it in to my Christian faith.

## Projects

### Web Component Decorators

As part of my effort to use vanilla JS more often, I've been spending a lot of time building a series of Web Components, sans framework. While I love projects like Stencil JS, I am not a fan of being tied to using their preferred bundler in order to use their tools. So I dug in to the plain Web Components API, and built a few JS Decorators to make the process a lot smoother. I look forward to publishing them as soon as I pressure test them a little more, so stay tuned!

### Elassus

I love functional CSS. In my opinion it is _a_ solution which solves a lot of problems that have been ravaging our CSS the last several years. As such, a few years back I built my own functional CSS library called Elassus. The beauty of it, is that every class is generated using variables and functions, and is customizable to the _nth_ degree; I mean, even the class name syntax is customizable! Though I haven't made updates to it in a couple years, I still use it for some projects because it really doesn't have any issues that need to be addressed (Outside of adding support for CSS Grid).
